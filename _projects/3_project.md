This project leveraged experimental data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau regarding community resilience to diseases such as Covid-19. Based on how many risk factors were observed in a particular region, a community's resilience could be examined at the state, county, and census tract level. The number of risk factors present in any one area contributed to a location's overall community resilience score.

Insights from this project were presented to senior state officials in (D) Governor Sisolak's administration and quoted publicly in remarks regarding economic diversification across the state.
