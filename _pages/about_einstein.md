I am a Master’s of Computer Science student focusing on machine learning and software systems. Most recently, I was an Intern on the Applied Fintech Research team at the Federal Reserve where I worked on various projects related to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

Prior to graduate school, I completed my Bachelor’s of Science in Economics and received a Minor in Mathematics from the University of Nevada, Reno (2020). I also spent a year as an undergraduate Visiting Student studying financial economics at Columbia University (2019).

During my time at UNR, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Department of Economics and the Department of Statistics. I also completed an internship at the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development. At Columbia, I participated in the Columbia Space Initiative, Columbia Financial Investment Group, and the Columbia Economics Society.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
