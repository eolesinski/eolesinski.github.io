I am a Masterâ€™s of Computer Science student focusing on machine learning and software systems. Most recently, I was an Intern on the Applied Fintech Research team at the [Federal Reserve](https://www.bostonfed.org) where I worked on various projects related to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

Prior to graduate school, I received my Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Economics and Minor in Mathematics from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu). I also spent a year as an undergraduate Visiting Student, studying financial economics and computer science, at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu).

While at UNR, I was a Research Assistant in the Department of Economics where I worked with [Prof. Mehmet S. Tosun](https://www.unr.edu/business/faculty-and-staff/tosun-mehmet). I also completed an internship at the [Nevada Governorâ€™s Office of Economic Development](https://goed.nv.gov). At Columbia, I participated in the Columbia Space Initiative, Columbia Financial Investment Group, and the Columbia Economics Society.
